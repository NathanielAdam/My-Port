  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    Here I present everything I do, including 'Hello World!' apps. It's a good
    roadmap and will help as I look to learn everything I can.

  <h2>"Completed" Projects</h2>
  <p>
    Here we have projects that are "done" and are subjectable to being revisted
    for creativity sake or as a disection and re-tutoring of the languages used.
    It should go without saying but this portfolio is in and of itself a project
    being worked on and maintained.
